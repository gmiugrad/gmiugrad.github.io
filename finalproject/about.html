        </center>
        <p style="text-align:left;">The <a href="http://apw.dhinitiative.org/" target="_blank">American Prison Writing Archive</a> is a digital, open access archive created 
          by Professor Doran Larson at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York. It houses essay submissions from anyone with first-hand experience of the 
          US Carceral system, including incarcerated people, visitors, prison guards and employees, and teachers. Its aim is “to replace 
          speculation on and misrepresentation of prisons, imprisoned people, and prison workers with first-person witness by those who live 
          and work on the receiving end of American criminal justice.”</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;"> About this Project </h2>
        <p style="text-align:left;">This project was created to statisfy the final project requirements of ILS-Z603 - 
          'Digital Publishing Standards and Systems' at Indiana University - Bloomington. All essay content is taken from 
          the American Prison Writing Archive. All other content was created/styled by Grayson Murphy.</p>
