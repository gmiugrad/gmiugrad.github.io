        <ingredients> 
            3/ 4 cup almond meal
            1 1/2. tbsp plain flour
            1/ 4 cup sugar
            sog unsalted butter
            1largeegg
            1/2 tsp vanilla extract
            2 sheets of puff pastry
            2 to 3 apples sliced
            extra butter melted and 1 tbsp sugar
        </ingredients>
        <step1>
            Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. Place the pastry 
            on a lined oven tray to thaw. Cut 1 sheet into 
            4 squares and prick all over with a fork to 
            stop it puffing up too much and other one I 
            choose to have it as a round circle.   
        </step1>
         <step2>
             For frangipane filling, cream the sugar
             and butter together until light. Add egg
             and mix to combine. Finally add the
             almonds, extract to combine   
         </step2>
         <step3>
             Spread the frangipane evenly into the
             puff pastry sheets leaving 1 cm from the
             edges. Arrange the apples slices in a
             pretty petal pattern.
         </step3>
         <step4>
             Brush with melted butter and sprinkle
             with the extra sugar. Bake for about 20-25
             minutes till the pastry is puffed and
             golden around the edges.
             Drizzle with honey and serve with dollop
             of double cream. 
         </step4>
